      <h3>Why I Love Live Music</h3>

      <p class="hobby">Nothing brings me more joy than watching talented musicians in action.
        Each small variable in a live musical performance carries incredible weight.
        Some acts have a strict structure that they repeatadly follow, while others walk
        on stage with the intent of giving the audience something they have never heard before. I appreciate
        the discipline of the former, but I am always more impressed by the latter. As soon as an act
        steps on stage and begins to play they are at the mercy of the audience. When a band plays in 
        this improvisational style, the feeling that it is "US vs Them" can not be subdued. They must stick together, 
        listening to each other, making sure not to miss any queues to change beat, key, or to end the song. Every melody that appears in 
        each members head must be carefully considered based on the audience and fellow band members. All of these decisions
        are made in a split second. Each decision has an inpact on the audience and the band, therefore, having an impact on the next decision.
        The audience is tense. They are anticipating for the whole thing to fall apart right in front of them. A truly talented act might even lead the 
        audience to believe this, only to bring it all back just in time. These subltlties are what makes an improvised musical performance so special.
        This is what I think music should be. The connection is real, the feedback is instant, and every act is unique.
