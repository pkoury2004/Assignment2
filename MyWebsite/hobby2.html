      <h3>Why I Love to Read</h3>
      <p class="hobby">One of my favorite things to do is read. What I love about literature is an authors ability
        to make you an observer in a world that you do not belong to. To do this properly, an author
        must be able to describe a scene down to the last minute detail. The lighting in the room, 
        the smell of the air, the facial expressions and inner-thoughts of the characters, and the small 
        visual queues that often are not described in the retelling of events. These details are constantly 
        changing as the story progresses and the scenes change. It is up to the author to keep the reader up
        to date on the relevant changes. I think that no one does a better job of this than
